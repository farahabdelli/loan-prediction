# loan_prediction machine learning project
### Steps to solve machine learning projects
1. start by importing data
2. data selection
3. data description : A story of data is all abot and the features present in the data
4. performing both statistical and graphical data analysis
5. data tranformation and derivation of new attributes , if necessary
6. selection of machine learning algorithms based on the patterns observed in EDA
7. data standardization and normalization
8. creation of train and test data sets
9. model training using machine learning algorithms
10. calculation of model accuracy : both training and testing accuracy
11. hyper parameter tuning to achieve a better accuracy 
12. saving the created model file 
13. Deployement strategies for model
14. production deployment and testing
